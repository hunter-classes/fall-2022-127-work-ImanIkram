John Blackeye: <pirate>, It's a beautiful day to go fishing! What do you say Betha? We can go down the lake just like old times. I will get the boat ready while you gather up all the tools. 
Betha: <pirate>, I am too tired to go out and fish. Besides, there is no fish left in that lake. 
John Blackeye: <insult>! you are coming with me.
